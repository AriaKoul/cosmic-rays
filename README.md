# Cosmic-Rays-Classification

This repository contains code where I use a machine learning algorithm to classify the type of particle in primary cosmic rays. Using a dataset from another [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aguillenATC/Entropy-CompositionClassificationUHECR/tree/master), my machine learning algorithm uses PyTorch to classify whether the primary cosmic rays is made out of photons, protons, helium, nitrogen, or iron. 

All information and background about this project is written in the Jupyter Notebook.
